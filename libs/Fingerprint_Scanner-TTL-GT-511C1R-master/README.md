*Fingerprint Scanner - 5V TTL (GT-511C1R)(SEN-13007)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13007)

This library takes code, originally written by Josh Hawley, for the GT-511C3 sensor and changes it slightly to remove bugs when working with the GT-511C1R sensor.

This is a great fingerprint module from ADH-Tech that communicates over TTL Serial so you can easily embed it into your next project.

This repository contains example code to work with it.
